Prodigy Cyber Security Internship - Task 1 - Implement Caesar Cipher

Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

Below is a Python program showing how to do this:

[Please check the attached file called caesarcipher.py.]

In this program, the function called caesar_cipher does the hiding and revealing part. It checks if you want to hide the message (by typing "E") or reveal it (by typing "D"). The main part of the program talks to you, asking for your message, the secret number, and whether you want to hide or reveal the message. Then, it uses the caesar_cipher function to do what you asked and shows you the result. If you make a mistake and type something wrong, the program will tell you so. You can try running this program on your computer using Python.
